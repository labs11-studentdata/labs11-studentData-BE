# Labs11 Non Profit Student Data

Many non-profits work to solve primary and secondary school educational challenges in remote and low resource environments.  This app provides a way for school administrators, board members and social workers to communicate and keep track of student data. Student data may include name, grade level, a place to upload an optional picture, background story, status at the school (student, past student, or visitor), age, insurance card (Y/N) and expiration date, birth certificate, special needs, childâ€™s representative and contact info. It also allows administrators to add new categories to track.  There is also an option to sponsor a child with unpaid school dues.
